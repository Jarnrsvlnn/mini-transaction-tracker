# mini-transaction-tracker


## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This mini project is a simple **transaction tracker** built in PHP.  
It demonstrates how to:

- Display transactions in an HTML table.  
- Apply basic formatting (income in green, expenses in red).  
- Perform simple calculations:  
  - **Total Income**  
  - **Total Expenses**  
  - **Net Total**
 
 ## ðŸ”Ž Notes
- The date format used is `Jan 4, 2021`.
